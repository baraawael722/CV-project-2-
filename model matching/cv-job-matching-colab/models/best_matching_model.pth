The file `models/best_matching_model.pth` is a binary file that contains the saved state of the best-performing model during training. Since this file is generated during the training process and is not meant to be manually created or edited, it cannot be generated as text content.

To use this file in Google Colab, you should run the training process defined in `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`, which will create and save the `best_matching_model.pth` file automatically when the model training is completed. 

Make sure to upload the necessary CSV files and the `src/cv_job_matching_model.py` script to your Colab environment before running the notebook.
